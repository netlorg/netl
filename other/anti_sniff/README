Hi -

Read the LICENSE file. You are now bound by it.

make by itself should give you the build options.

Have fun, learn, enjoy.

You need to be root to get the raw device.

The promisc count should be set to >0 if it detects a machine in promisc
mode. 

The ICMPTIMETEST needs you to make a human guess in this version (we took
care of that with a whole bunch of magic in the windows version). If you 
see that the averages for the clean run and the run while flooding are
way way off you probably have a sniffing machine.

Oh yeah, read the NOTES file for more info on the proggie.

cheers,

.mudge
