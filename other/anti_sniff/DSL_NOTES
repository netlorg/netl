This program is *not* intended for use on anything other than
local ethernet connections. DSL and other devices can often times get
confused and bothered.

With that being said we've found wonderful results on dsl lines. Hit the
broadcast addresses (go through all the bit boundaries) and see which 
linux boxes, freeBSD boxes etc are in promisc. Then hit the NT bug
to see which NT machines that are not at your residence but are in promisc.
This seems to happen as the dsl modems often times seem happy to send traffic
out in a flooding style if they do not recognize the ether addr. Of course,
your mileage may vary. 

Many of the DSL modems seem to be extremely chatty when it comes to 
handling things they are not familiar with.

Second, they seem to bridge just about everything if you tickle them correctly.

The Westell, for example, exhibits a strange feature in re-forwarding
packets with it's own mac address if it does not understand the dest 
ether-addr. This is disturbing. To wit:

  dest ether addr of ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:00 with a target IP address of say
  10.10.10.12 will, after the first packet is not responded to, be
  resent to the address of 10.10.10.12 (if it exists) with the correct
  ether address and a return address of the DSL box - not the originating
  sender.
