In reality I should have gone through and 

   . cleaned stuff up
   . made it a more logical build directory
   . gotten rid of the large makefile abomination and replaced it with
     a ./configure script
   . moved to a threaded or entire semaphore setup as opposed to taking
     advantage of nuances in various kernels and how they handle interrupted
     system calls. This is why you see that I went the quick way out and
     just created separate linux_* files.

But, I've been really busy with the merging of the L0pht and @Stake. I'm
doing my best to make sure that the people working with me get everything
they need to learn and explore -- and are reminded that the world does not
move forward in productive ways unless you contribute to it!

It was more important for me to get this out to the community than to 
sit on it promising myself I'd make it as clean as I would want (and more than
likely not getting to it due to the other time constraints).

With that being said - anti_sniff researchers version now compiles and runs on 
redhat 6.1 with kernel 2.2.12-20 now. 

One of the nice parts is that you don't need to modify the kernel for
truly raw ether frames as you do on BSD. 

Feel free to go at it and add/remove/modify and most importantly -> learn!
