Thanks to all of those who have encouraged and supported the L0pht 
throughout the years.

The various tests used by AntiSniff were discovered by various
people who we would like to credit here:

The ARP test was discovered by DilDog of L0pht Heavy Industries.

The Ether Ping (ICMP/IP kernel processing bug) test are based off of
ideas from Hobbit and Mudge and independently found by Ivan Arce of CORE.

The latency measurement tests are based off ideas and concepts from
research work performed by Thomas H. Ptacek, Jennifer Dawn Myers,
Mark Hittinger, and indirectly by Charles Ewan Macmillan and
Mike Scher.


cheers,
