NAME

dcp - discrete communication protocol client.


SYNOPSIS

dcp message [port]


DESCRIPTION

dcp is a way of passing messages to netl(8) and related programs.  
in the case of netl(8) there is currently only two messages you can
send it.

"netl:readconfig" will order netl(8) (if it's listening, see the man
page for details on the listen directive) to terminate it's current
configuration and read the netl.conf file again.  this is handy if you
make modifications to netl.conf while netl(8) is running.

"hwpassive:write" tells hwpassive(8) to write its database to disk.  
it is wise to do this occasionally, in case of system crash.


EXAMPLE

run netl(8) with the listen directive, then type this, as a ordinary
user:

% dcp "netl:readconfig"

if it worked, then there should be a note in the netl output (typically,
this is sent to syslogd) that the configuration was re-read.


SEE ALSO

netl(8), netl.conf(5), netlcc(1), netl_install(1),
netl_module(1), neta(1), hwpassive(8), hwlookup(1),
dcp(1) and xd(1)


BUGS

there are almost certainly bugs, please report them to me.  send bugs and
bug fixes to netl@netl.org.  the netl home page is at
http://www.netl.org, which should contain up to date information on
netl.

i have attempted to write pretty readable documentation, however, i'm not
really the best technically writer.  if you are, maybe we could
colaborate?
