NAME

neta - network packet analyzer


SYNOPSIS

neta [options] file [...]


DESCRIPTION

neta is a network packet analyzer.  it was designed to decode an IP
packet stored as a file.  usually this will be a packet dumped by
netl(8).  first the address is shown, followed by header data.  the
final part is a hex dump, which displays offset, hex data, and character
data. because the header data is interpreted for you, it is not included
in the hex dump.


OPTIONS

neta uses a subset of the options from netl(8).  these include -h,
-r and -v.  the reminder do not make sense.


SEE ALSO

netl(8), netl.conf(5), netlcc(1), netl_install(1),
netl_module(1), neta(1), hwpassive(8), hwlookup(1),
dcp(1) and xd(1)


BUGS

there are almost certainly bugs, please report them to me.  send bugs and
bug fixes to netl@netl.org.  the netl home page is at
http://www.netl.org which should contain up to date information on
netl.

i have attempted to write pretty readable documentation, however, i'm not
really the best technically writer.  if you are, maybe we could
colaborate?
