NAME

netlcc - convert netl configuration files into netl modules / gcc front end for netl modules


SYNOPSIS

netlcc [gcc options] netl.conf


DESCRIPTION

PLEASE NOTE: the netl compiler is still somewhat experimental.  you
are encouraged to use it to generate netl modules which you then
modify by hand.

netlcc takes a netl configuration file and converts it into a
netl module, which can be loaded dynamically.  the advantage to a
netl module is that it is compiled code and therefore theoretically
faster.  any .conf files are given to netl(8) to generate a .c file.  
this .c file is then compiled using gcc(1), with any other options
that have been passed to the command line.  by default, a .so (shared
object file) is generated, which can be copied into the netl modules
directory.

for more information on the netl configuration format, see
netl.conf(5).

for more information on netl modules, see netl_module(1).

for more information on netl in general, see netl(8).


OPTIONS

netlcc grabs two options, if seen, and passes the rest to gcc when it
reaches the compile stage.  therefore all the options you would expect to
work for a compiler such as -c or -O2 should work with netlcc.

-generate-c

	generate c code and stop.  this is handy, if you want to hand
optimize the module generated from your configuration file.

-install

	once the module has been compiled successfully, this option will
direct netlcc to install it in the correct place so that netl(8)
can find it.  this option only works when compiling modules from
configuration files.

BUGS

there are almost certainly bugs, please report them to me.  send bugs and
bug fixes to netl@netl.org.  the netl home page is at
http://www.netl.org, which should contain up to date information on
netl.

i have attempted to write pretty readable documentation, however, i'm not
really the best technically writer.  if you are, maybe we could
colaborate?
