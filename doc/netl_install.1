.B netl_install
- 
.I netl
install instructions.
.PP
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
these are directions for installing the 
.I netl
package.  you will need
to download the 
.I netl
package.  the latest version should be available
at ftp://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/Linux/system/network/monitor/
.PP
.SH DIRECTIONS
.PP
 AS NOT ROOT:
.PP
 1. edit `Makefile.inc' and `global.h' with your favorite text editor.  
if your
    platform is supported, you shouldn't have to do anything but change
    CFLAGS or one of the global config items at the top of global.h.
.PP
 2. type `make'
.PP
 3. optionally run the regression tests.  you will need perl.
    type `make test'.  any failed tests will produce `.ao' (actual
    output) files which you can read, if you speak gibberish.
    alternatively, you can e-mail me .ao files for any failed test case.
.PP
 4. take a look at conf/netl.conf.  modify it to your liking.
    in the very least, READ IT, as this will save you a lot of trouble.
.PP
 AS ROOT
.PP
 5. type `netl -z -fconf/netl.conf -L.' to try out the configuration.
    go to another virtual terminal and send yourself a ping (or something
    else you are logging), come back and see if it shows up on the
    screen.
.PP
    the -z tells 
.I netl
to run in the foreground, -f indicates the
config
    file and -L is for the module directory.  see 
.I netl
(8) for more
    information on 
.B netl
options.
.PP
 6. type `make install'
.PP
 7. copy conf/netl.conf to your /etc directory, and run `netl' with no
    arguments to have it run in the background.  when it runs in this
    manner, output is sent to syslog and will show up in your
    ~adm/messages file (unless you modify /etc/syslog.conf).  you may
want
    to run 
.B netl
from one of your startup scripts in /etc/rc.d or
    thereabouts.
.PP
 8. read the documentation.  start with the 
.B netl
(8) man page.
