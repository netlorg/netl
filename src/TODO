. this is my little note pad for things to do on netl.  if you're
  interested in working on any of these aspects of netl, please let me
  know by sending email to netl@netl.org.  i can provide you with
  documentation, and also make sure that these things don't get
  implemented twice.

 * add ipx protocol
 * add igmp protocol (a proper implementation)
 * add arp protocol
 * PPP interface
 * win32 port
 * write/use a loadable kernel module which filters packets for me
 * make a pg output module
 * finish off perl/Tk interface prototype
 * Gtk+/Gnome interface
 * implement a config set, so you can say things like "$pg::pghost = fred.com"
