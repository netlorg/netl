NAME

hwpassive - passively scan for, and keep a database of hardware/ip
address mappings.


SYNOPSIS

hwpassive [options] ['config rule'] [...]


DESCRIPTION

hwpassive is a program for gathering hardware/ip address mappings.  
it is implemented as a netl(8) module and perl(1) script front
end.  when hwpassive sees a hardware address it has not seen before,
or if the existing mapping is different, then it will send it to syslogd
(default) or stdout (with the --background option).

hwpassive writes its database to /usr/local/lib/netl/hwpassive on
exit, if it has changed, or if you send it the dcp(1) message
"hwpassive:write"


OPTIONS

hwpassive accepts all the same options and config rules as netl(8).
of special interest would be ignore rules which could be used to filter
out packets being sent into or out of your local network.  for example,
if your network were 10.* :

% hwpassive 'ignore ip !srcip=10.0.0.0/8' 'ignore ip !dstip=10.0.0.0/8'
% ping 10.255.255.255

would be an active method for getting nearly all the hardware/ip address
mappings for the hosts on your local area network.

(note that you may have to escape the `!' character on some shells)


DCP COMMANDS

hwpassive will accept four dcp(1) commands, each is prefixed be
`hwpassive:' so that they will be ignored by any other program listening
for dcp(1) commands.

hwpassive:write

this instructs hwpassive to write the entire database to disk, regardless
of weather the database has changed since the last save.

hwpassive:print

instructs hwpassive to print out the entire ip/hardware address mapping
database.  each entry is presented as

hw:hw:hw:hw:hw:hw => ip [first] [last]

where hw is the hardware address, ip is the ip address (and may
either be a dotted decimal, or a DNS hostname), first is the full date
of the first time the mapping was seen by hwpassive and last is
the last time the mapping was seen by hwpassive.

hwpassive:lookhw:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx

makes a query for the hardware address xx in the database.  this may
return multiple results, if the one hardware address is mapped to more
than one ip address (which may happen, especially in a dhcp network (see
dhcpd(8) and dhcpcd(8), where ip addresses are assigned
dynamically)).

hwpassive:lookip:hostname

makes the reverse query for hostname.  again, more than one mapping
will be returned.  if the host is not found in the database, or DNS fails
to find the host, then the appropriate error message will be logged.


HISTORY

the genesis for this program came about when the author and a friend of
his were tracking quake users on their university LAN.  thanks to the
networking knowledge of said friend, determined programming of the author,
and dominos pizza, we were able to track nearly every anonymous quaker to
an email address, phone number, dorm, and sometimes even their room
number.

note that neither the author, nor the author's friend play quake anymore,
and do not condone the senseless violence in many of today's video games.

BUGS

there are almost certainly bugs, please report them to me.  send bugs and
bug fixes to netl@netl.org.  the netl home page is at
http://www.netl.org which should contain up to date information on
netl.

i have attempted to write pretty readable documentation, however, i'm not
really the best technically writer.  if you are, maybe we could
colaborate?
