NAME

xd - hex dump


SYNOPSIS

xd filename [ ... ]


DESCRIPTION

xd will give you a hex dump of the files provided on the command line.  
in addition to the hex values, you get the (readable) ASCII values, and
the offset of the byte beginning on each line.  xd is a scaled down
version of the classic od(1).  xd was abstracted out of the
neta(1) source code in the netl(8) distribution, which is usefull
for sniffing logging arbitrary ethernet frames.

BUGS

there are almost certainly bugs, please report them to me.  send bugs and
bug fixes to netl@netl.org.  the netl home page is at
http://www.netl.org which should contain up to date information on
netl.

i have attempted to write pretty readable documentation, however, i'm not
really the best technically writer.  if you are, maybe we could
colaborate?
