NAME

netl_guts_yy_line_number,
- current netl config line number.


SYNOPSIS

#include <netl/api.h>

extern int netl_guts_yy_line_number;
 

DESCRIPTION

the current line number, when reading from the configuration file.  
since netl modules never read the configuration file, it is only useful
if you are working within the netl core.


SEE ALSO

netl(8), netl_api(3), netl_module(1)


BUGS

there are almost certainly bugs, please report them to me.  send bugs and
bug fixes to netl@netl.org.  the netl home page is at
http://www.netl.org which should contain up to date information on
netl.

i have attempted to write pretty readable documentation, however, i'm not
really the best technically writer.  if you are, maybe we could
colaborate?
