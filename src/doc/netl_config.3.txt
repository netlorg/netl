SYNOPSIS

#include <netl/api.h>

void netl_config_readfile(char *filename, int nbg);
void netl_config_parseline(char *configline);
void netl_config_pre(void);
void netl_config_post(void);
void netl_config_set(void *l);
void netl_config_clear(void);
extern int netl_config_listenport;
 

DESCRIPTION

routines for reading a netl(8) configuration file netl.conf(5).

before using any of the configuration functions, you should all
netl_config_pre and when done, call netl_config_post.  they
currently do nothing, though they may preform some initilization work in
the future.

netl_config_readfile reads the file filename and loads netl(8)
modules (netl_module(1)) as necessary for later use by the packet
grab event loop.  nbg should always be 1.  netl_config_parseline
parses the configura tion line given by configline

if you want to start from scratch, you may use netl_config_clear
to erase the current configuration.  from there, call netl_config_pre,
netl_config_readfile or netl_config_parseline, and then
netl_config_post as you usually would.

you should not use netl_config_set unless you understand the internals of
core netl(8) better.

netl_config_listenport is the port which dcp will listen to, if the
module is loaded.  see dcp(1) and netl(8)  for more information.

BUGS

there are almost certainly bugs, please report them to me.  send bugs and
bug fixes to netl@netl.org.  the netl home page is at
http://www.netl.org which should contain up to date information on
netl.

i have attempted to write pretty readable documentation, however, i'm not
really the best technically writer.  if you are, maybe we could
colaborate?
