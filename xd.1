.SH NAME
xd \- hex dump
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B xd
filename [ ... ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBxd\fR will give you a nifty hex dump of the files you give it.  along
with the ultra useful ascii values (only the readable ones), and the offset
of the byte beginning on each line.  \fBxd\fR doesn't have as many nifty 
options as the more classical \fBod\fR(1) for example, but on the other
hand this means you don't have to memorize anything.  \fBxd\fR was just 
taken from the \fBneta\fR(1) source code in the \fBnetl\fR(8) distribution,
but isn't that interesting unless you want to sniff/log network packets.
.SH OPTIONS
none
.SH SEE ALSO

.SH BUGS
almost certainly.  please send bug reports/fixes to me
