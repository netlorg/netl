before we get to a final release on netl:

 * consider an ipx logger

 * better documentation, maybe a man page

 * figure out why it's dumping core on sparc linux

 * store the hostname lookup cache as a binary tree
   (sorted by native version of the IP)

 * hwpassive program to passivly get hardware => IP mappings

 * port aliasing

 * perl path

 * localname?
