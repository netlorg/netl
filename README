netl is (c) 1996, 1997 Graham THE Ollis

what is netl?
-------------

netl will log or dump any ip datagram you might like to log or dump.  by
log i mean it sends a nify message in to syslogd.  by dump i mean it will
save the datagram to a file in /tmp/netl.  see the netl.conf file for
information on hwo to configure.

netl doesn't really care if the destination addresses happen to be yours,
unless you specify it to be so.  for this reason, netl sort of doubles as
a sniffer. 

portability
-----------

netl should work on any linux platform.  however i've only been able to
test it on my personal intel linux station.  i have made consideration of
the fact that the playfor it is compiled on may not in fact be little
endian.  the big endian code is actually simpler and leads me to think big
endian hardware is better for networking.

netl probably won't work on any other unix platform with out a lot of
work.  if you are sucessful in porting netl to other platforms, please let
me know what you did and i can add the apropriate code to my netl source. 

how do i install it?
--------------------

 AS NOT ROOT:

 1. type `make'

 AS ROOT

 2. type `make install'

 3. create the directory /tmp/netl

 4. take a look at netl.conf.  modify it to your liking then copy it in to
    /etc

 5. execute netl
