version .95
-----------

 . created man page documentation.

 . added `detect' config line, see the netl(8) manpage for details.
   this will reduce the amount of configeration you will have to do
   in the netl.conf file.

 . modified dist version of netl.conf so that it's more portable.
   in particular, i put in literal port numbers rather than using
   port names.

 . dcp.pl uses perl native Socket module instead of using net cat.
   `dcp.pl -o' uses the old method.

version .94
-----------

 . changed all the struct declerations to typedef declerations.  get off my
   back ok?  i've been programming perl for so long, forgot some of that
   strange C language. 

 . no longer depending on linux .h files for IP (and sub) headers.  this
   is for portability reasons.  if you are doing a port, make sure you get
   the endian type right!  there are now three global headers:
	global.h - general global stuff (endian integer conversion etc.)
	ether.h - ethernet specific data types, #defines
	ip.h - ip protocol specific data types, #defines
   logically, if your adding an interface (ATM, token ring, ppp, etc.)
   you'd want to start in ether.h.  if your adding an OS, look at global.h
   first.  if you want to add a protocol (IPX, etc.) start with ip.h and
   modify/add to these files.  if your trying to do all of this at once,
   god help you. 

 . fixed the clearipcache() function.  thus now, when you send a 
   netl:readconfig, netl will clear the ip cache before reading the file,
   avoiding all sorts of potential duplicates.  though you probably have
   an enourmous amount of memory like me and don't care... 

 . added some global options with ports to win32 in mind.  NO_SYSLOGD, if 
   defined in global.h will not even compile with the syslogd library stuff.  
   this is a good idea if your running from a non unix system.  note that 
   syslogd is really nice in that it partially compresses lines by indicating 
   repeated lines.  this won't save you if you get strobed, but will keep your 
   log file neat if some one ping -f's you from only one site.

 . added NO_TEEOUT option which is defined for unix.  the -o option should 
   only be necessary in win32 only.  even then, you should only compile with
   this option if your thinking of using it.  -o copies output to the specified
   file.

0.93 (and 0.92)
---------------

 a. -z option allows you to run netl in the foreground.  output is sent to
    stdout instead of syslogd.

 b. you can include configeration lines in the command line.  when you do
    this, the config file /etc/netl.conf will NOT be read.  note that (a)
    and (b) are meant to be used in concert with each other for testing
    and quick monitoring. 

 c. dcp is partially implemented.  netl will listen to port 47 udp
    (silently) if you `listen 47' in your config file.  when you send the
    message `netl:readconfig' netl is suppose to re read your config file. 
    dcp.pl is a perl script (you'll need net cat for this to work) which
    sends this message.  what is left to do for dcp?
	1. generic server side dcp interface libdcp.a file or somesuch.
	2. more solid C version of dcp client.

 d. netl is now officially under the GPL, see COPYING for more information.

 e. icmp codes are now included in some .h file somewhere rather than
    depending on your linux being overly up to date.

 f. neta no longer swaps source/destination ip/ethernet addresses
    inapropriately. 

 g. started work on hwpassive, which is no where near complete.

 h. tdr.pl is no included with netl distribution for convenience.  get
    your own version at:
