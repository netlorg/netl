quick directions:

% make
% su
# ./netl -z -fnetl.conf
ping localhost => localhost
ping localhost => localhost

[ go to another virtual console or X-window and ping localhost.  if this
shows up on stdout on this screen then you know that netl works.  press
Ctrl-C.  note that for every ping it is normal to get two pings for every
actual ping because with loopback you get both the `sent' icmp and the
`received' icmp, even though they are actually the same frame ]

# make install
# cp netl.conf /etc

[ you can probably edit this with little knowledge of how netl is
configured.  most of the useful patterns are already included, but some
may have been commented out.  it is worth taking a look at the netl man
page, especially the CONFIG FILE section which describes this
configuration format in excruciating detail ]

# netl
# tail -f ~adm/messages

[ now your ready to run it, and send the output to syslogd.  you may need
to change ~adm/messages in order to get the right file.  this works on a
standard slackware install.  if you like to have netl running all the
time, then you may want to add it to the appropriate /etc/rc* file.  on
my systems it is run from /etc/rc.d/rc.local.

that's it.  if you are interested in more information take a look at the
README file provided in the netl distribution.  it goes in to all sorts
of details.
