NAME

netl_install - netl install instructions.


DESCRIPTION

these are directions for installing the netl package.  you will need
to download the netl package.  the latest version should be available
at http://www.netl.org


DIRECTIONS

 AS NOT ROOT:

 1. type 'sh configure'

configure takes a few options which may be of interest, try
'sh configure --help' for information.  in general, the defaults are
reasonable.

 2. type `make'

 3. optionally run the regression tests.  you will need perl. type `make
test'.  any failed tests will produce `.ao' (actual output) files which
you can read, if you speak gibberish. alternatively, you can e-mail me
.ao files for any failed test case.

 4. take a look at conf/netl.conf.  modify it to your liking. at least,
READ IT, as this will save you a lot of trouble.

 AS ROOT

 5. type `netl -z -fconf/netl.conf -L.' to try out the configuration. go
to another virtual terminal and send yourself a ping (or something else
you are logging), come back and see if it shows up on the screen.

the -z tells netl to run in the foreground, -f indicates the config
file and -L is for the module directory.  see netl(8) for more
information on netl options.

 6. type `make install'

 7. copy conf/netl.conf to your /etc directory, and run `netl' with no
arguments to have it run in the background.  when it runs in this manner,
output is sent to syslogd and will show up in your ~adm/messages file
(unless you modify syslog.conf(5)).  you may want to run netl from
one of your startup scripts in /etc/rc.d or thereabouts.

 8. read the documentation.  start with the netl(8) man page.


TK NETL

there is now a perl/Tk front end for netl, which you can optionally
install after the netl base has been installed.  you will need perl5 and
Tk8 or better.  these can be found at

ftp://ftp.cdrom.com/pub/perl/CPAN/src/
ftp://ftp.cdrom.com/pub/perl/CPAN/by-module/Tk/

once those are installed, you're ready to install tknetl.

 1. `cd face/perltk' from the netl dist.

 2. `perl Makefile.PL'
	this may ask you questions about where the netl library directory
or header files are located.  unless you did something funny when
installing the netl base, Makefile.PL should be able to find the library
unaided.

 3. `make'

 4. `make test'
	optionally.  currently the tests are very basic, essentially
making sure the Netl perl modules load correctly.  this doesn't even
check to see if you have perl/Tk.

 5. `make install'
	you may have to be root to do this, depending on how perl is
installed.

 6. `tknetl'
	should open up the tk version of the netl GUI interface.

BUGS

there are almost certainly bugs, please report them to me.  send bugs and
bug fixes to netl@netl.org.  the netl home page is at
http://www.netl.org which should contain up to date information on
netl.

i have attempted to write pretty readable documentation, however, i'm not
really the best technically writer.  if you are, maybe we could
colaborate?
